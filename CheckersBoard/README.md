# CheckersBoard

This project implements a simple checkerboard in C++, utilizing nested loops and the modulus operator to create a checkerboard pattern. The program prints a grid representing a checkerboard with alternating black and red squares.

## Features

- Prints an 8x8 checkerboard to the console.
- Alternates between black and red squares using the modulus operator.
- Allows easy customization of the checkerboard size and colors.
  

## How It Works

The program uses nested loops:
- The outer loop iterates over the rows of the board.
- The inner loop iterates over the columns of each row.
- A conditional statement with the modulus operator (`%`) determines whether to print a black or red square based on the row and column numbers.
